# TMpesa World Mini App Checklist

This app is built as a World App Mini App first. The normal web URL is only for testing and Vercel preview.

## Implemented in the Repo

- MiniKit is installed through `@worldcoin/minikit-js`.
- The React root is wrapped with `MiniKitProvider`.
- Login prefers World Wallet Auth and verifies SIWE through `/api/complete-siwe`.
- Sell-side in-app crypto sending uses the World Pay command.
- Payment references are created server-side through `/api/payment-reference`.
- World Pay results are verified through `/api/confirm-payment`.
- Supported World Pay assets are `WLD` and `USDC`.
- The receiver wallet is `0x0f029f35a9da4043ff84b2c98a023d0a68eb64b4`.
- The M-Pesa till number is `5698981`.
- The support email is `brianokindo@gmail.com`.
- Browser preview mode remains available for testing outside World App.

## Required World Developer Portal Setup

- World App ID captured from Developer Portal: `app_02bd6decc052fc1dfa29487444f6c6f`.
- Set `APP_ID` and `VITE_WORLD_APP_ID` in Vercel to `app_02bd6decc052fc1dfa29487444f6c6f`.
- Create a Developer Portal API key and set it as `DEV_PORTAL_API_KEY` in Vercel.
- Whitelist the receiver wallet address for World Pay.
- Configure app name as `TMpesa`, not `WorldTMpesa`, to avoid implying official World affiliation.
- Upload the app icon and content card/banner assets from `public/`, or replace them with final PNG exports.
- Test the production Vercel URL inside World App using the official Mini App testing QR flow.
