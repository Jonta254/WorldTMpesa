# WorldTMpesa

This repository contains `TMpesa`, a React + Vite World mini app for manually exchanging crypto and Kenyan Shillings through M-Pesa. It now includes Vercel API functions for backend nonce generation, SIWE verification, and World payment verification, while user/order operations still remain in `localStorage` until a database is added.

## Features

- Local signup and login
- World App wallet-auth entry path
- Dashboard with quick actions
- Sell flow: crypto to KES with in-mini-app WLD send
- Buy flow: M-Pesa to crypto
- Orders page with status tracking
- Admin simulation page for manual confirmation
- Admin-editable rates, receiver wallet, M-Pesa details, and support email
- Gmail support and payment-delay actions for users
- Vercel API backend for nonce generation, SIWE verification, and World payment confirmation

## Product Context

- Built to run as a World App mini app with MiniKit integration
- Keeps a browser preview mode so the UI can still be tested outside World App
- Uses World App wallet auth as the preferred entry path, with local login only as a fallback for development
- Uses World `Pay` for the WLD sell flow inside the mini app when opened in World App
- Includes repo assets in `public/` for favicon, icon, manifest, and content-card placeholder
- World wallet auth now uses a backend nonce and server-side SIWE verification
- WLD sell payments now call a backend confirmation endpoint before the app records the send
- User and order persistence still uses localStorage until a database is added

## Important Prototype Note

- Before production payouts, whitelist the receiver wallet in the World Developer Portal
- Before multi-device admin usage, move users/orders/settings from localStorage into a real database
- World recommends Wallet Auth as the primary login flow for mini apps and backend verification for the returned payloads, which this project now implements through Vercel API routes

## Review-Safe Naming

- The repository remains `WorldTMpesa` for continuity
- The in-app display name is `TMpesa` because World's review guidelines say mini app names should not use `World`

## Source Structure

- `src/config`: app-level constants and storage keys
- `src/services`: auth, orders, local storage, and World App integration
- `src/hooks`: shared UI logic such as the order flow state machine
- `src/routes`: top-level route definitions
- `src/components/auth`: auth-only reusable UI
- `src/components/layout`: shell and route protection
- `src/components/orders`: order cards and status display
- `src/pages/auth`: login and signup screens
- `src/pages/app`: dashboard, orders, and admin screens
- `src/pages/trade`: buy and sell transaction flows

## Local Storage Notes

- Users are stored locally in the browser
- Orders are stored locally in the browser
- Rates and app settings are stored locally in the browser
- World auth and payment verification are now handled by backend API routes under `api/`

## Backend Routes

- `GET /api/nonce`: create a backend nonce for SIWE
- `POST /api/complete-siwe`: verify the World wallet auth payload on the server
- `POST /api/payment-reference`: issue a backend payment reference before WLD send
- `POST /api/confirm-payment`: confirm a World payment with the Developer Portal API
- `GET /api/health`: quick backend health/config check

## Environment Variables

Create env vars from [.env.example](C:/Users/ADMIN/Documents/Codex/2026-04-19-i-need-to-star-a-new/.env.example):

- `APP_ID`: your World mini app id, used for payment verification
- `DEV_PORTAL_API_KEY`: World Developer Portal API key, used to confirm World payments

## Demo Admin Account

- Phone: `0700000000`
- Password: `admin123`

## Run Locally

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. For frontend-only preview, start the app with `npm run dev`
3. For full backend testing, run through Vercel so `/api/*` routes are available
4. Open the deployed URL inside World App when you want to test MiniKit behavior

## GitHub Ready

This folder is prepared to be pushed to GitHub.

- `node_modules` and build output are ignored in [.gitignore](C:/Users/ADMIN/Documents/Codex/2026-04-19-i-need-to-star-a-new/.gitignore)
